# Netguard: A Comprehensive Network Security Dashboard

> An all-in-one, containerized solution for live network traffic monitoring, threat detection, and security analysis, orchestrated with Docker and powered by the Elastic Stack.

This project provides a powerful and interactive dashboard to visualize network traffic, detect intrusions, and analyze security events in real-time. It leverages a suite of best-in-class open-source tools, all running seamlessly as Docker containers.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Live Packet Analysis:** Captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time using Tshark, Zeek, and Suricata.
-   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Utilizes Suricata for high-performance, rule-based threat and anomaly detection.
-   **Rich Traffic Logs:** Generates detailed and structured logs for various protocols (HTTP, DNS, SSL, etc.) using Zeek.
-   **Interactive Frontend:** A modern, responsive dashboard built with React to visualize alerts, network flows, and security metrics.
-   **Robust Backend:** Powered by a high-performance FastAPI backend to serve data to the frontend.
-   **Centralized Data Hub:** Aggregates logs and alerts from all services into Elasticsearch using Filebeat for powerful searching and analytics.
-   **Automated CI/CD:** Uses GitHub Actions to automatically build, test, and deploy the application, ensuring code quality and stability.
